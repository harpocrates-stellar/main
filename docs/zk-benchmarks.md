# ZK Proof Generation and Verification Benchmarks

Harpocrates needs reproducible performance and memory baselines for proof
generation and verification across browser, native, CI, and Soroban-adjacent
targets. Without them, a silent latency or memory regression can turn a
privacy-preserving path into an availability failure — or push operators to
log sensitive material while debugging.

This document covers the harness, threat assumptions, signals, configuration,
rollout/rollback, and limitations.

## Components

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `zk/bench/bench.lock.json` | Iterations, timeouts, size ceilings, concurrency, privacy policy |
| `zk/bench/zk_bench.py` | Schema, stats, privacy checks, runners, compare/trend CLI |
| `zk/bench/test_zk_bench.py` | Unit tests (no nargo/bb required) |
| `zk/bench/run.sh` | Hermetic environment wrapper |
| `zk/bench/browser_runner.mjs` | Node/bb.js prove+verify timings (browser-equivalent) |
| `zk/bench/results/` | Local reports (gitignored; never commit proof material) |
| `zk/bench/baselines.lock.json` | Optional committed thresholds (absent ⇒ compare is inert) |
| `.github/workflows/zk-ci.yml` | Runs `pytest zk/bench` alongside artifact tooling |

## Redaction-lineage feasibility (prototype)

`redaction_lineage` is not enabled by default. It has `MAX_CHUNKS = 4` and
therefore accepts at most four committed media chunks per proof; deployments
must set a conservative media canonicalisation limit before enabling it. The
prototype currently has no calibrated constraint count, proving time, or
verification time because the pinned Noir toolchain is not available in this
checkout. Record those values from `nargo info` and the native/browser bench
harness with synthetic fixtures before promotion, and reject any candidate that
cannot meet the configured timeout and memory ceilings. Never benchmark real
source media or write witness material into reports.

## Targets

| Target | What is measured |
| --- | --- |
| `native` | Host CLI path (`nargo`/`bb` when present; synthetic fallback only when `--synthetic`) |
| `browser` | Node + `@aztec/bb.js` UltraHonk prove/verify (same stack as the Evidence Studio worker) |
| `ci` | CI-tagged run; synthetic driver allowed so PR checks stay hermetic without the proving toolchain |
| `soroban_adjacent` | Host CPU/memory budget envelope for `register_anonymous_verified` / public-input classify (see `test_budget.rs`) |

Cold samples approximate a fresh process/worker. Warm samples discard
`warm_discard` iterations, then record `warm_samples`. Percentiles are computed
only over successful measured samples.

## Threat assumptions

The harness defends against:

- **Unbounded work.** Sample counts, proof/public-input/witness byte ceilings,
  concurrency, per-sample timeouts, and a wall-clock cap are enforced by
  `bench.lock.json`. Oversized or capacity-exceeding work fails with a typed
  reject code — never hangs.
- **Partial promotion.** A report is written only when `outcome=ok`. Timeouts,
  cancellations, rejections, and fatals abort without leaving a trusted report.
- **Evidence leakage.** Reports and stderr signals carry timings, percentiles,
  byte counts, digests/metadata, and machine codes. They never carry witness
  bytes, proof hex, public-input hex, credential/nullifier secrets, or
  signatures. This is pinned by `test_zk_bench.py` privacy cases.
- **Hostile duplicate load.** Concurrent bench slots above
  `min(limits.max_concurrency, target.max_concurrency)` are rejected with
  `capacity`.

It does **not** replace production admission control or on-chain verification.
It also does not claim cross-host wall-clock equality; reports include runtime
metadata so operators can compare like with like.

## Report schema

```text
format: "harpocrates.zk-bench"
version: 1
target: native | browser | ci | soroban_adjacent
fixture_id: silent_witness.synthetic.v1
toolchain: { nargo, bb, proving_scheme, oracle_hash }
runtime: { os, arch, cpu_count, python_version, ci, hostname_hash, ... }
phases[]:
  phase: prove | verify
  cold / warm: { samples_ms, percentiles?, states }
  percentiles?: { p50, p95, p99, min, max, mean, count }
  sizes: { proof_bytes, public_input_bytes, witness_bytes?, acir_bytes?, vk_bytes? }
  memory: { peak_rss_bytes? }
outcome: ok | timeout | cancelled | rejected | fatal
```

Fixture material is synthetic only. Real user evidence is out of scope.

## Local verification

```bash
# Tooling only — no proving toolchain required.
python -m pytest zk/bench -q
zk/bench/run.sh run --target ci --synthetic
zk/bench/run.sh metadata

# Optional: real browser-equivalent path after compiling circuits and
# installing frontend dependencies.
cd frontend && npm ci
# build ACIR via zk/noir scripts, then:
node zk/bench/browser_runner.mjs --cold 1 --warm 2
```

## Configuration

| Knob | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| per-target sample counts / timeouts | `zk/bench/bench.lock.json` | Bound work |
| size ceilings | `limits.*` | Reject oversized proof/PI/witness/report |
| privacy forbidden keys | `privacy.*` | Fail closed if a report grows a sensitive field |
| baselines path | `thresholds.baselines_path` | Optional regression gate |

Hermetic env vars mirror the reproducible-build pipeline: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0`,
`TZ=UTC`, `LC_ALL=C`, `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`.

## Signals

Single-line JSON on **stderr**:

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `bench.start` / `bench.done` | Run boundaries |
| `bench.sample` | One sample terminal state (+ elapsed_ms when ok) |
| `bench.fallback` | Synthetic driver used (missing toolchain/artifacts) |
| `bench.report_written` | Successful promotion of an ok report |
| `bench.aborted` | Non-ok outcome; no report written |
| `bench.compare_inert` / `bench.compare_ok` / `bench.regression` | Threshold gate |
| `bench.cancelled` / `bench.fatal` | Terminal failure |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Ok (or compare inert) |
| `1` | Threshold regression |
| `2` | Usage error |
| `3` | Fatal / timeout / cancel / reject |

## Deployment impact and rollout

1. Land harness + unit tests + docs. CI runs **unit tests only** (synthetic).
2. Collect reports manually or via optional workflows on pinned hardware.
3. Calibrate and commit `zk/bench/baselines.lock.json` with percentile/size caps.
4. From that commit on, `zk_bench.py compare` fails regressions.

Until baselines exist, compare prints `inert` and exits 0 — same pattern as the
artifact manifest drift check.

## Rollback

- **Disable threshold enforcement:** delete `zk/bench/baselines.lock.json`.
- **Discard local reports:** delete `zk/bench/results/`.
- **Revert the harness:** revert the `zk/bench/**` and docs commit; no contract,
  codec, or proof-format migration is involved.

No undocumented repair step is required.

## Troubleshooting

**`nargo/bb not available and synthetic disabled`** — install the pinned
toolchain from `zk/toolchain.lock.json`, or pass `--synthetic` for a CI-style
timing envelope.

**`missing_artifacts` from `browser_runner.mjs`** — compile circuits first
(`zk/noir/scripts/build-silent-witness.sh` or the reproducible build).

**Compare always inert** — expected until baselines are committed.

## Limitations

- Synthetic CI timings are deterministic envelopes for harness correctness, not
  substitutes for calibrated UltraHonk wall-clock on real hardware.
- Soroban-adjacent figures track host budget envelopes from `test_budget.rs`;
  they are not wall-clock UltraHonk verification inside the VM.
- Cross-architecture percentile equality is not guaranteed; use `runtime`
  metadata when comparing reports.
- Proof hex and witnesses are intentionally never stored in reports; artifact
  digests belong to the reproducible-build manifest, not this harness.
