# Harpocrates Video Service

Flask service for video proof packaging, steganographic metadata extraction,
and local developer proof tooling.

## Steganography

`POST /api/stego/embed` accepts a video and JSON metadata, then returns an
embedded `video/mp4` artifact. The encoder writes two layers:

- border encoding for lossy-transcode-tolerant recovery
- LSB encoding as a secondary fallback

Response headers include the source video hash, embedded video hash, and
canonical metadata hash. The frontend registers the embedded video hash on
Stellar.

`POST /api/stego/extract` reads the embedded artifact, hashes the received file,
and returns extracted Harpocrates metadata when present.

## Upload and Verification Load Test

With FFmpeg installed and a local testing backend running, execute a bounded
load run from this directory:

```bash
python load_test.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:5050 --mode load --concurrency 2 --total-ops 10 --output /tmp/harpocrates-load-report.json
```

The `upload_verification` workload sends generated synthetic video through
`POST /api/stego/embed`, then sends the returned artifact through
`POST /api/stego/extract` and checks that its synthetic marker and proof ID
match. It uses no real media, credentials, proofs, or private keys. Failure
reports contain status codes or dependency categories, never response bodies;
the configured URL is reduced to its origin before it is written to a report.
Run it only against a local or dedicated test backend: successful uploads may
create ordinary synthetic proof-event records when a database is configured.
No protocol, API schema, or database migration is introduced. Rollback is
limited to removing the workload, its focused coverage, and this documentation;
use normal test-data retention procedures for any synthetic events already
created.

## Noir Developer Worker

`POST /api/noir/silent-witness` generates video-specific Silent Witness proof
artifacts using the local WSL Noir toolchain.

The request must include `videoHash`, `credentialSecret`, and
`nullifierSecret`.

Environment override:

```text
NOIR_PROOF_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180
```

The product flow now uses browser-side Noir JS and bb.js, so user-entered
private seeds stay in the browser. This endpoint is kept for local parity tests,
debugging, and CI-style proof generation.

## Privacy-Safe Service Metrics

`GET /metrics` exposes service workload, latency, status code distributions, and bounded upload-size metrics in standard Prometheus format.

### Privacy Guarantees

- Metric labels strictly record generic HTTP attributes: HTTP `method`, parameterized route rule `endpoint` (e.g., `/api/proofs/by-video/<video_hash>`), and HTTP `status`.
- Filenames, video hashes, metadata hashes, wallet addresses, proof payload data, and secret seeds are strictly excluded.
- Upload sizes are recorded in bounded histogram buckets.

### Endpoint Protection

- `METRICS_ENABLED`: Enable or disable the metrics endpoint (`true`/`false`, default `true`). Returns `404` when disabled.
- `METRICS_TOKEN`: Optional authentication token. When set, requests must provide `Authorization: Bearer <METRICS_TOKEN>` or header `X-Metrics-Token: <METRICS_TOKEN>`.
- `METRICS_PATH`: Endpoint URI path (defaults to `/metrics`).

### Prometheus Scraping Configuration

Example `prometheus.yml` snippet:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'harpocrates-backend'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    authorization:
      credentials: 'secret-scraping-token' # matches METRICS_TOKEN
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['127.0.0.1:5050']
```

## Run

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5050`.

## Runtime Configuration

```text
APP_ENV=development
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=5050
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=262144000
MAX_METADATA_BYTES=16384
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
EXPOSE_METADATA_HEADER=false
METRICS_ENABLED=true
METRICS_TOKEN=secret-scraping-token
METRICS_PATH=/metrics
NOIR_WORKER_ENABLED=true
NOIR_PROOF_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
VERIFIER_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=10000
VERIFIER_CACHE_POSITIVE_TTL_SECONDS=86400.0
VERIFIER_CACHE_NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS=300.0
```

Production notes:

- Set `APP_ENV=production`.
- Set `NOIR_WORKER_ENABLED=false` unless this service is intentionally acting as a hardened prover.
- Keep `EXPOSE_METADATA_HEADER=false`; extracted metadata is available through `/api/stego/extract`.
- Protect the `/metrics` endpoint in production by configuring `METRICS_TOKEN` or restricting access at the reverse proxy/ingress layer.
- Avoid wildcard CORS. `CORS_ORIGINS=*` requires `ALLOW_WILDCARD_CORS=true`.
- Configured origins are enforced server-side: requests carrying an `Origin`
  outside `CORS_ORIGINS` are rejected with `403 FORBIDDEN_ORIGIN` before route
  handlers run (privacy-safe envelope; the origin value is never echoed or
  logged). Requests without an `Origin` header and the `/health`, `/ready`, and
  `/metrics` paths are exempt.
- Uploaded files are processed in temporary directories and removed after each request.

## Health

```text
GET /health   liveness only
GET /ready    database, ffmpeg/ffprobe, and local worker readiness
GET /metrics  privacy-safe Prometheus metrics endpoint
```

## Verifier Proof Cache

`verifier_cache.py` memoizes Noir verifier results with positive and negative
TTLs. Cache keys are **domain-separated**: a SHA-256 digest over the versioned
cryptographic domain tag `harpocrates:verifier-cache:v1` followed by
length-prefixed `domain`, `network`, `circuit_version`, `verifier_version`,
`proof_hex`, and `public_inputs_hex` fields. Length-prefixed framing makes the
payload injective over the field tuple, so separator-like characters in any
field cannot shift a boundary and collide two distinct results. Proof and
public-input hex are case- and whitespace-canonicalized so the same proof
cannot fragment into case-variant entries.

Bump `CACHE_KEY_DOMAIN_TAG` (e.g. to `...:v2`) whenever the key field layout
changes: it orphans every previously cached entry instead of silently reusing
results derived under a different scheme. Keys are digests only — proof
material is never stored in plaintext or logged.

## Test

```powershell
python -m unittest test_app.py test_stego.py
```

The service uses temporary files while processing and does not persist uploaded
source videos.
