- Added a CI end-to-end environment matrix (`devx/e2e_env_matrix.py`) that exercises public API boundaries across development/testing/production-like profiles with privacy-safe failure checks.

- Added an atomic compatibility manifest and release gate spanning frontend,
- Added a cross-layer compatibility report that publishes version, interface, and digest alignment across frontend, backend, circuit, verifier, and registry without embedding private material.

  `respond_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`, `dismiss_dispute`,
  `supersede_dispute`, `get_dispute`, `get_open_dispute_count`) with bounded
  open-dispute caps, reporter cooldowns, respond/resolve deadlines, cycle-safe
