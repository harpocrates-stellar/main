# Dispute And Supersession State Machine

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** `HarpocratesRegistry` (`contracts/contracts/harpocrates-registry`)

A dispute is a bounded, auditable record that challenges a proof's accuracy
**without deleting or revoking the original proof**. Disputes are a separate
axis from revocation: a disputed proof may still report `Valid` under
`get_proof_status`. Supersession is the terminal transition that links a
disputed proof to a corrected proof.

## 1. State Machine

```text
Open --respond(issuer/source/admin)--> Responded
Open --dismiss(admin)----------------> Dismissed
Open --supersede(admin, corrected)--> Superseded
Responded --resolve(admin)-----------> Resolved
Responded --dismiss(admin)-----------> Dismissed
Responded --supersede(admin)-> Superseded
```

`Resolved`, `Dismissed`, and `Superseded` are terminal. A terminal dispute can
never be re-opened or transitioned again; retries fail with a stable error and
emit no event.

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAX_OPEN_DISPUTES_PER_PROOF` | `4` | Cap on simultaneous non-terminal disputes per proof. |
| `REPORTER_COOLDOWN_SECS` | `86400` | Minimum interval between two disputes by the same `reporter_hash` on the same proof. |
| `RESPOND_DEADLINE_SECS` | `604800` | Window for the issuer/source to respond. |
| `RESOLVE_DEADLINE_SECS` | `1209600` | Window for the admin to resolve after a response. |

---

## 2. Public Interface

```text
open_dispute(reporter, reporter_hash, dispute_id, proof_id, reason, commitment_hash) -> DisputeRecord
respond_dispute(responder, dispute_id, response_commitment) -> DisputeRecord
resolve_dispute(admin, dispute_id) -> DisputeRecord
dismiss_dispute(admin, dispute_id) -> DisputeRecord
supersede_dispute(admin, dispute_id, superseding_proof_id) -> DisputeRecord
get_dispute(dispute_id) -> Option<DisputeRecord>
get_open_dispute_count(proof_id) -> u32
```

* `open_dispute` requires the reporter's own authorization. `dispute_id` must
  be fresh, the proof must exist, the open-dispute cap must not be exceeded,
  and the reporter must not be on cooldown.
* `respond_dispute` is authorized for the proof's issuer (Tier 3) or source
  (Tier 2); for Tier 1 anonymous proofs only the admin may respond.
* `resolve_dispute`, `dismiss_dispute`, and `supersede_dispute` are admin-only.

### Failure codes (stable, append-only)

Existing dispute codes keep their values. New ones were appended:

| Code | Name | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `45` | `DisputeNotFound` | Unknown `dispute_id`, missing proof, or missing superseding proof. |
| `61` | `TooManyOpenDisputes` | `MAX_OPEN_DISPUTES_PER_PROOF` already reached. |
| `62` | `DisputeWindowExpired` | Respond/resolve deadline passed. |
| `63` | `DisputeAlreadyClosed` | Transition attempted on a terminal dispute. |
| `64` | `DisputeCyclicSupersession` | Self-cycle or direct 2-cycle in supersession. |
| `65` | `UnauthorizedResponder` | Caller is neither the proof's issuer/source nor admin. |
| `66` | `ReporterOnCooldown` | Same `reporter_hash` re-reporting within the cooldown. |
| `67` | `InvalidDisputeTransition` | State does not permit the requested transition. |

Duplicate `dispute_id` reuses the existing `DuplicateProof` (`4`) code.

---

## 3. Privacy Properties

* The reporter's address is **never** stored in contract state. Callers supply
  a 32-byte `reporter_hash = H(reporter_address || proof_id)` commitment; the
  cooldown is keyed by that commitment.
* Dispute events carry only commitments, enums, IDs, and epoch-second
  timestamps. No media, proof bytes, witnesses, raw metadata, or private keys
  are written or emitted.
* `reporter_hash` is an opaque value from the contract's perspective: a caller
  could submit a different commitment to evade per-reporter cooldown, so the
  cooldown is a spam-throttle, not an identity guarantee. On-chain spike
  detection belongs in indexers, which observe `["dispute", "open", dispute_id]`.

---

## 4. Typed Events

```text
["dispute", "open", dispute_id]       => proof_id, reason, reporter_hash, commitment_hash, respond_deadline
["dispute", "respond", dispute_id]    => proof_id, response_commitment, resolve_deadline
["dispute", "resolve", dispute_id]    => proof_id, resolved_at
["dispute", "dismiss", dispute_id]    => proof_id, resolved_at
["dispute", "supersede", dispute_id]  => proof_id, superseded_by, resolved_at
```

Failed, rejected, and cancelled calls emit no event and do not mutate storage
(Soroban invocations are atomic).

---

## 5. Storage, Migration, And Rollback

All dispute state is new, additive persistent storage:

```text
Dispute(dispute_id)              -> DisputeRecord
ProofOpenDisputeCount(proof_id)  -> u32
ReporterCooldown(reporter_hash)  -> u64
Lineage(output_digest)           -> LineageRecord   (restored lineage key)
```

Existing deployments have none of these keys populated, which reads as
"no disputes". Upgrading to this wasm is therefore backward compatible with no
migration step and no change to `ProofRecord`, `ProofVerifierStatus`, or any
pre-existing exported function signature.

Rollback to a pre-dispute wasm simply drops the dispute entry points; the
`Dispute*`/`ReporterCooldown` entries become inert and are ignored by the older
code. There is no forward dependency and no data to clean up.

The supersession cycle guard keeps a compact reverse index at
`DataKey::Dispute(SHA-256("harp_sup_rev" || superseding_proof_id))`. The 12-byte
prefix makes collision with a legitimate caller-chosen `dispute_id`
computationally implausible; a collision would at worst reject a supersession,
never authorize one.

---

## 6. Threat Notes

* **Spam / storage exhaustion.** Bounded by `MAX_OPEN_DISPUTES_PER_PROOF`,
  `REPORTER_COOLDOWN_SECS`, fixed-size records, and the admin-only terminal
  transitions.
* **Evidence destruction.** Disputes never modify or delete the disputed
  `ProofRecord`. `supersede_dispute` links a corrected proof and leaves the
  original in place; operators must call `revoke_proof` separately if
  revocation is also required.
* **Cycle abuse.** `supersede_dispute` rejects self-links and direct
  (length-2) cycles; only the admin can create supersession edges.
* **Privacy regression.** Only commitments are persisted or emitted. The
  dispute path is not gated by domain pause, so incident response
  (`revoke_proof`, `revoke_issuer`) stays available while a tier is paused.

## 7. Tests

`contracts/contracts/harpocrates-registry/src/test_dispute.rs` covers positive,
negative, boundary, and regression cases: happy-path open/respond/resolve,
duplicate `dispute_id`, unknown proof, open cap, reporter cooldown, unauthorized
responder, expired respond/resolve windows, resolve-before-response rejection,
non-admin authorization, dismiss from open/responded, dismissed terminal
retry, counter release on dismissal, supersession linking, unknown/self/reverse
cycle rejection, and proof-status invariance.
